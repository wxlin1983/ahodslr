This is a dslr control library wrapper that can be used to control Canon DSLR on MS Windows. Support for Nikon is not done because I don't have a Nikon camera (yet).

You will need to download Canon SDK from their official website. I suggest you updating your camera to the latest firmware, otherwise this code might not work.

Tested with Canon SDK v2.15.
